# Traffic Lights Controller
This is my attempts at assignments (Laboratory 5) from HCMUT's Digital Design Laboratory course. 


This project is made in IntelÂ® Quartus II 13.0sp1, for Terasic's DE2 FPGA board. However, to modify the codes to fit any board you want.

Here are the requirements. All credit goes to Department of Electronics, Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology.
